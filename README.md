## Circular Linked Lists

A Circular Linked List is similar to a singly linked list, except the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. This allows for continuous traversal from the head node without hitting a `NULL` terminator.

### Features
- Elements are connected in a circular manner.
- No `NULL` at the end of the list.

### Use Cases
- Implementing round-robin scheduling.
- Managing the playlist in music players.

## Singly Linked Lists

A Singly Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next node in the sequence. It consists of nodes that contain data and a pointer to the next node. The last node points to `NULL`, indicating the end of the list.

### Features
- Simple structure with a linear connection.
- Only one reference to the next node.

### Use Cases
- Implementing dynamic memory allocation.
- Creating stacks and queues.

## Doubly Linked Lists

A Doubly Linked List is similar to a singly linked list, but each node also maintains a pointer to the previous node, in addition to the next node. This allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.

### Features
- Nodes have pointers to both the next and previous nodes.
- Allows bidirectional traversal.

### Use Cases
- Implementing navigation systems.
- Managing browser history.

## Queues

A Queue is a First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added to the back (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue). It is commonly used in scenarios where order needs to be preserved, such as processing tasks or handling requests.

### Features
- Elements are processed in the order they arrive.
- Enqueue operation adds elements to the back.
- Dequeue operation removes elements from the front.

### Use Cases
- Task scheduling.
- Handling requests in web servers.

## Heaps

A Heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property. There are two types of heaps: max-heap and min-heap. In a max-heap, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. In a min-heap, the value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues.

### Features
- Binary tree structure.
- Max-heap or min-heap property.

### Use Cases
- Implementing priority queues.
- Performing heap sort.

## Trees

A Tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a root node at the top and child nodes below. Each node contains data and references to its children. A Binary Tree is a type of tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and right child.

### Features
- Hierarchical structure.
- Nodes have children.

### Use Cases
- Organizing hierarchical data.
- Implementing binary search trees.

## Graphs

A Graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected. Common operations on graphs include traversal methods like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). BFS explores nodes level by level, while DFS dives deep into one branch before backtracking.

### Features
- Collection of vertices and edges.
- Can be directed or undirected.

### Use Cases
- Representing social networks.
- Modeling transportation systems.

## Stack

A Stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added to (push) and removed from (pop) the top of the stack. It is often used in scenarios requiring reverse order processing, such as undo mechanisms in text editors.

### Features
- LIFO structure.
- Push and pop operations.

### Use Cases
- Implementing undo mechanisms.
- Evaluating expressions.
